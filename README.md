This repository is designed to help me practice and perfect the GitHub Flow.
Hello, I'm Samuel, a curious and creative mind with a passion for exploring new ideas and technologies. While I'm not a developer by trade, I love learning about the latest advancements in software and digital media, and finding ways to apply them to my own projects. I'm always looking to collaborate with others who share my interest in pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Let's work together to build something innovative and exciting!
